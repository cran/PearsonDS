Changes in version 1.3.1 (2024-02-08)

Bug fixes:

- Windows builds were limited to x86_64 CPUs due to an an oversimplified 
  configure script. Many thanks to Tomas Kalibera for not only pointing out 
  the problem, but also for providing a patch.

Changes in version 1.3.0 (2023-08-12)

New features:

- new function matchMoments that completes (incomplete) sets of moments by 
  completing them for a given distribution type (if possible) and returning 
  the complete set of moments or the resulting distribution..
  (suggestion/wish from Michael Koohafkan) 

Changes in version 1.2.4 (2023-06-14)

Small changes:

- empMoments(x) now returns NA if x contains missing values.

- a misleading error message (in case package gsl is not installed) has been
  removed.

Changes in version 1.2.3 (2022-10-20)

Small changes:

- changed encoding to UTF-8.

Bug fixes:

- fixed compiler note about missing prototype.

- fixed wrong character in comment.

Changes in version 1.2.2 (2022-03-29)

Bug fixes:

- replaced deprecated legacy S-compatibility macro DOUBLE_EPS. Many thanks to 
  Prof Brian Ripley for the report and the instructions for solving the issue.

Changes in version 1.2.1 (2021-10-06)

Bug fixes:

- fixed obsolete Autoconf constructs. Many thanks to Kurt Hornik for the report
  and the instructions for solving the issue.

Changes in version 1.2 (2021-06-10)

Bug fixes:

- documentation of type I/II/VII has been corrected (the missing constant 
  1/|s| has been added to the probability density functions in the 
  documentation; the implementations were not affected).
  (Many thanks to Prof. David Fox for reporting!)

Small changes:

- changed the name of the probability density function in the documentation 
  of type IV to f(x) (from p(x)) in order to improve consistency.
  
- update of author information.

Changes in version 1.1 (2017-07-17)

Small changes:

- changed (inappropriate) CR/LF line ending of configure.ac to LF line ending
  (reported by Prof Brian Ripley).

Changes in version 1.0 (2017-03-03)

Small changes:

- added registration of native routines (in reaction to recent CRAN check
  notes), thereby fixing wrong (lower case) PACKAGE argument (reported 
  by Kurt Hornik).

- changed sample size in example of pearsonMSC in order to reduce run-time.

Changes in version 0.98 (2016-06-06)

Bug fixes:

- implementation and documentation of type V has been corrected. It was 
  mentioned in the documentation that the scale parameter corresponds
  to the reciprocal value of the usual scale parameter (aka rate) of
  the inverse gamma distribution, but this was neither implemented correctly 
  nor was the probability density function (from the help page) 
  right. 
  The scale parameter now corresponds to the usual scale parameter
  of the inverse gamma distribution, the implementation and the documentation
  have been corrected and adapted. 
  (Many thanks to Andrew Beck for reporting!)
  
Small changes:

- replaced CHANGES with NEWS (and using corresponding markup). 

- added many importFrom directives to NAMESPACE and replaced calls to 
  require with calls to requireNamespace (as suggested by package 
  CHECK).

- removed CITATION file (which would be equal to default citation info).

Changes in version 0.97 (2013-11-20)

Bug fixes:
  
- bug fix (and speedup) of random number generation for Pearson type IV 
  distributions. (Many thanks to Dave DeMers for reporting!).
  
Changes in version 0.96 (2013-10-02)
  
Small changes:

- dispensable file 'LICENSE' removed (due to check NOTE).
  
- dispensable use of ':::' removed (due to check NOTE).
  
Changes in version 0.95 (2013-01-11)
  
Small changes:

- calls of (deprecated and soon-to-be-defunct) function 'is.real' replaced 
  with calls of 'is.double' (reported by Prof Brian Ripley).

Changes in version 0.94 (2012-09-25)

Bug fixes:

- ensure that functions to be minimized by nlminb do not return NA or NaN
  any more (by replacing NA/NaN results with +Inf) because nlminb does
  not work reliably with NA/NaN function values.
  (Many thanks to Prof Brian Ripley for pointing this out)
  
- bug fix of pearsonDiagram (for max.skewness>=32 [squared.skewness=TRUE]
  and max.skewnewss>=sqrt(32) [squared.skewness=FALSE])
  
New features:

- new function pearsonMSC for model selection purposes.
  (suggestion/wish from Dr. Ross Larsen Ph.D) 

Changes in version 0.93 (2012-04-02)
  
Small changes:

- caching of package gsl's availability status removed, because using
  'installed.packages' or 'require' in .onAttach should be avoided 
  (as NOTEd in check results since [about] R-2.15.0). Slow down should be 
  negligible.
  
- correction of link to Heinrich's working paper
  
Changes in version 0.92 (2010-04-23)
  
Bug fixes:

- NAs and NaNs were not handled properly in ppearsonIV and qpearsonIV

- (documentation) bug fix:
  typo in the density function for Pearson type VI (only pdf-manual)
  many thanks to Young Hwa Sung for reporting the typo!

Changes in version 0.91 (2009-09-29)
  
Bug fixes: 

- autoconf/configure mechanism was messed up -> no MacOS X binary on CRAN
  Many thanks to Simon Urbanek <simon.urbanek@r-project.org> for his valuable
  help (and autoconf lesson)!

Changes in version 0.90 (2009-09-16) 

New features
  
-  initial release
