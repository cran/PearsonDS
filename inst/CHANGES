  0.97 (20.11.2013)
  
  bug fix (and speedup) of random number generation for Pearson type IV 
  distributions. (Many thanks to Dave DeMers for reporting!)
  
  0.96 (02.10.2013)
  
  dispensable file 'LICENSE' removed (due to check NOTE).
  
  dispensable use of ':::' removed (due to check NOTE).
  
  0.95 (11.01.2013)
  
  calls of (deprecated and soon-to-be-defunct) function 'is.real' replaced 
  with calls of 'is.double' (reported by Prof Brian Ripley).

  0.94 (09.05.2012-25.09.2012)

  ensure that functions to be minimized by nlminb do not return NA or NaN
  any more (by replacing NA/NaN results with +Inf) because nlminb does
  not work reliably with NA/NaN function values.
  (Many thanks to Prof Brian Ripley for pointing this out)
  
  bug fix of pearsonDiagram (for max.skewness>=32 [squared.skewness=TRUE]
  and max.skewnewss>=sqrt(32) [squared.skewness=FALSE])
  
  new function pearsonMSC for model selection purposes.
  (suggestion/wish from Dr. Ross Larsen Ph.D) 

  0.93 (02.04.2012)
  
  caching of package gsl's availability status removed, because using
  'installed.packages' or 'require' in .onAttach should be avoided 
  (as NOTEd in check results since [about] R-2.15.0). Slow down should be 
  negligible.
  
  correction of link to Heinrich's working paper

  many thanks to Young Hwa Sung for reporting the typo!

  0.91 (29.09.2009)
